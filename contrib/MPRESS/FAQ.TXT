[1]  Which compression algorithm uses MPRESS?

A. LZMAT. It's very similar to well known LZ77, but has some
   advantages.


[2]  What advantages of this compression?

A. LZMAT does not require huge resources for compression, for
   decompression it does not require resources at all.
   It has extreamly fast compression/decompression speed,
   a few times faster then LZ78 and even faster then LZO.
   It could process unlimited size of blocks unlike LZ77/
   LZ78/LZO with size of block limited to 64k. LZMAT has
   very small decompression procedure which allows to make
   in-place decomprassion.

   
[3]  Whether I need to buy some license in order to use MPRESS?

A. No. MPRESS is absolutely free of charge software. Read the
   license which is included in  the  distribution package.
   MPRESS does not contain any code which is under different 
   license (i.e. GPL, LGPL etc.), therefore you can use MPRESS
   for your commercial project without needs to make it
   opensource.


[4]  "In-place decompression" - How does it work?

A. Technique wich decompresses data into the same memory
   called "in-place decompression".
   MPRESS does in-place decompression of the compressed data.
   This means that the applications packed with MPRESS does
   not require more virtual memory than the original unpacked
   versions.


[5]  Why MPRESS does not have decompression option?

A. It was planned in earliest releases to make such option for
   decompression the compressed application, but then we've
   figured out that it is not required. Most peaples are using
   packers not only to compress the application, but to protect
   their properties against decompilation and reverce engenering.
   MPRESS has the backup option in case if you would need the
   original application.


[6]  Can MPRESS protect my program against crackers?

A. MPRESS is not an envelope-protector, it is only a packer.
   But MPRESS is a good defense against non-professional
   hacker or reverce engeneres.


[7]  Do compressed files load faster or slower?

A. Most time, especially DLLs are loaded mutch faster, because
   they are smaller and require less read operations to load
   the executable image. 


[8]  I got a warning while compressing MS.NET application:
    "Assembly.Location property found - Will become null-string
     inside the compressed application."
     What should I use instead of Assembly.Location?

A. You could use instead of Assembly.Location one of
   Environment.CommandLine
   Process.StartInfo.FileName
   or Process.MainModule.ModuleName


[9]  What should I use instead of Module.FullyQualifiedName
   in my MS.NET application?

A. Use the same as above one of
   Environment.CommandLine
   Process.StartInfo.FileName
   or Process.MainModule.ModuleName
